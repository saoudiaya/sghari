<h5 align="center">This project consists of designing and developing a mobile application that provides parents with information on the location of the nearest nursery and kindergartens (GPS) and gives them an overall opinion on each nursery based on the opinions of other parents who have brought their children to the nursery in question.</h5>

<h2 align="left">1. Welcome Interface</h2>
<p>When you launch our application, you will be greeted by a series of three interfaces designed to inform you about the application and provide you with an overview of its features.
  
The welcome screen displays an appealing image related to the world of childhood, along with a brief welcome message inviting you to explore the application. You also have the option to proceed directly to the next screen by pressing the "Skip" button.</p>
<br>


<h2 align="left">2. Login Interface</h2>
<p>The login interface is the initial step that allows users to access their personal accounts.
It typically consists of two input fields: one for the email address or username, and the other for the password.
  
A "LOG IN" button is provided to allow users to validate their information and log in (Please note that all fields are mandatory to create your account during login).
Optionally, there may be a "Sign Up" button for new users who wish to register.</p>
<br>


<h2 align="left">3. Registration Interface</h2>
<p>The registration interface allows new users to create a personal account within the application. It includes several fields to fill out, such as First Name (firstname), Last Name (lastname), Address (address), Phone Number (phone number), Email Address (email), and Password (password). (Please note that during registration, all fields are mandatory to create your account).</p>
<p>Additionally, when entering your email address, please make sure to follow the appropriate format, for example, "aaa@gmail.com." The application will perform a check to ensure that the email address is valid and adheres to this specific format.
  
As for the password, it must consist of at least 8 characters. This ensures the security of your account by using a sufficiently long and complex password.</p>
<p>A "SIGN UP" button is provided to allow users to confirm their information and create their account.</p>
<p>Once you have completed the registration process, you will be automatically redirected to the login interface.</p>
<br>


<h2 align="left">4. Geolocation Interface</h2>
<p>The geolocation interface of our application provides a user-friendly and convenient experience for parents seeking nearby childcare facilities. As soon as you open this interface, you are greeted by an interactive map that automatically displays your current location. This geolocation feature allows you to quickly determine your position and visualize the nearest childcare centers.</p>
<p>Each nursery is represented by a marker on the map and a summary card. These cards contain essential and general information such as the name of the childcare center, the price, and the average rating from parents' reviews. When you click on a marker on the map or on a summary card in the list, you will access detailed information about the selected nursery.</p>
<p>If you wish to search for a nursery in a different location or find information about a specific nursery, a search bar is available. You can enter a new location or the name of a nursery, and the map will automatically recenter to this new position. This allows you to explore nurseries near that specific location and obtain detailed information about the ones that interest you.</p>
<br>


<h2 align="left">5. Search Interface</h2>
<p>The nursery search interface of our application provides you with a convenient and efficient way to find the ideal nursery for your child.
  
As soon as you access this interface, you are presented with a list of recommended nurseries, those with an average review rating higher than 3. These nurseries come highly recommended by other parents and serve as an excellent starting point for your search.</p>
<p>Continuing to browse the list, you will also find all the other available nurseries. When you click on one of the nurseries in the list, you are redirected to a detailed information page that provides you with all the relevant details about that specific nursery.</p>
<p>To facilitate your search, we have included a search bar that allows you to look for a specific nursery by its name or address.

Furthermore, you have the option to filter search results based on criteria such as price, capacity, and nursery category. This enables you to refine your preferences and quickly find a nursery that match your criteria.
</p>
<br>


<h2 align="left">6. Detailed Information Interface for a Specific Nursery</h2>
<p>The detailed information interface for a specific nursery in our application provides parents with all the necessary information to make an informed decision. When accessing this interface, you will find a variety of essential elements about the particular nursery.

Firstly, you will discover basic information such as the name of the nursery, the price, the category (nursery, kindergarten), the physical address, and the capacity. These details provide you with practical and logistical aspects of the nursery.

Next, a comprehensive description of the nursery is provided. You can learn more about educational values, offered programs, available facilities, and any other specific aspects of the establishment. This helps you understand the operation and educational approach of the nursery.
